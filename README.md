# SQLite Exercises for Workbook 9

This is a starter repository that holds the Workbook 9 exercises data in SQLite3 format, instead of MySQL. The main advantage is that we don't need to install any additional software to use and explore the databases, except for the [SQLite3 VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite)
